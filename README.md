# CycleGoWhere
- A mobile software application for casual and unacquainted cyclists which generates cycling routes based on a user's preferences, discovers scenic spots and bicycle parking areas and enables users to connect with each other and share their cycling journeys. 
- Used Python, Flask and Heroku for App Logic Layer (Back End)
- Used MongoDB and Atlas for Database 
- Used Flutter and Android Studio for Front End
- Used GoogleMapsAPI (Front End), OneMapAPI and DataGovMallAPI (Back End)

## Good Software Development Practices
- Feature Branch Approach -> Work in isolation without overwriting othersâ€™ code to increase code stability
- We did not use interfaces in our code as clients should not be forced to use interfaces that they do not use
- Performed Black Box (Equivalence class testing) and White Box testing to fully test the efficiency and functionality of our application
- Used S.O.L.I.D design principles such as Single Responsibility Principle. We have modularised our code so that any amendment in one method can be performed independently without affecting others.
